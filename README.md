# WordPress + Wistia

This plugin integrates the [Wistia](https://wistia.com) video platform with WordPress. It
facilitates the connection to Wistia's Upload API so you can upload videos to your account. It
also provides a simple custom post type for displaying your Wistia videos. This post type can
be enabled and used as-is, or you can extend it to create other Wistia-video-based post types.
